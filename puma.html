       <p>Puma SE, branded as Puma, is a German multinational corporation that designs and manufactures athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories, which is headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany.
       </br>
           Puma is the third largest sportswear manufacturer in the world.
        </br>
           The company was founded in 1948 by Rudolf Dassler.
        </br>
           In 1924, Rudolf and his brother Adolf "Adi" Dassler had jointly formed the company Gebr√ºder Dassler Schuhfabrik (Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory).
        </br>
           The relationship between the two brothers deteriorated until the two agreed to split in 1948, forming two separate entities, Adidas and Puma.
        </br>
           Both companies are currently based in Herzogenaurach, Germany.</p>
