       <p>Supreme is an American clothing and skateboarding lifestyle brand established in New York City in April 1994.[7][8][9]
       </br>
        The brand is targeted at the skateboarding and hip hop cultures, and youth culture in general.
    </br>
        The brand produces clothes and accessories and also manufactures skateboards.
    </br>
        James Jebbia, founder of Supreme, has said that the red box logo with "Supreme" in white Futura Heavy Oblique was taken from the work of Barbara Kruger.
    </br>
        Kruger herself commented on this issue on the occasion of a recent lawsuit between Supreme and a women's street clothing brand that used the Supreme logo to make a "Supreme Bitch" logo that was printed on T-shirts and hats.
    </br>
        In response, Kruger said, "What a ridiculous clusterfuck of totally uncool jokers.
    </br>
        I make my work about this kind of sadly foolish farce.
    </br>
        I'm waiting for all of them to sue me for copyright infringement</p>
